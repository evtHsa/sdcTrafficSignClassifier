<p>The summary is calculated by the <strong>__ init__()</strong>  method and displayed by the <strong>summarize</strong>() method of the <strong>DataDict</strong> class. The result, from the ipynb, is:</p>
<p>Number of training examples = 34799<br>
Number of validation examples = 4410<br>
Number of testing examples = 12630<br>
Image data shape = (32, 32,3)<br>
Number of classes = 43</p>

<p>In the selected signs(selection criteria described above) we can clearly see the effects of normalization and variations in image sharpness and lighting.</p>

<h4 id="preprocessing">1. Preprocessing</h4>
<p>I only implemented normalization of rgb values to [-1, 1] and resizing to 32x32x3. Resizing was required because the image(discussed later) downloaded from the web were larger and so did not work with the model’s input layer. Normalization accounted for a bit less than 2% improved accuracy which was sufficient to get over the 93% threshold.</p>
<h4 id="model-architecture">2. Model Architecture</h4>
<p>The model was a straight forward adaptation of my the model from the LeNet lab as described in the class video. The input layer was changed to 32x32x3 and the output changed from 10 to n_classes(43)<br>
<img src="./examples/lenet.png" alt=" " title="LeNet"></p>
<p>My final model consisted of the following layers:</p>

</table><h4 id="model-training">3.  Model Training</h4>
<p>I have a fairly robust CPU so I used that for training with the following hyperparameters:<br>
learning_rate -&gt; 0.00095<br>
mu -&gt; 0<br>
sigma -&gt; 0.1<br>
EPOCHS -&gt; 128<br>
BATCH_SIZE -&gt; 64<br>
GOOD_ENOUGH -&gt; 0.97</p>
<p>I did not use dropout and I believe dropout and/or generating additional images with affine transforms and lighting changes would produce better results. Perhaps also increasing the learning rate would help. With the current set of hyperparameters there seemed to be little improvement after the 100th epoch.</p>
<p>To train the model, I used an …</p>

Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.</h4>
<p>I chose LeNet because it was suggested in the course videos. Even though LeNet was originally designed for recognizing MNIST characters, my potentially naive view of why that was suggested was that recognizing “segments” in characters and their spatial relationships was relevant to sign classification because those attributes are present in signs.</p>
<p>My final model results were:</p>
<ul>
<li>validation set accuracy of 0.947(highest for any epoch was 0.952)</li>
<li>test set accuracy of 0.930</li>

<h4 id="predicition-certainty">3. Predicition Certainty</h4>
<p>The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the 2h cell of the Ipython notebook.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the following the model is highly certain (1.0). This is doubtless a consequence of picking images that were sharp and well lit. It is interesting to know that not all of the  lower 4 predictions are zero. Some of them are very small non zero values.<br>
